Guiding Case No. 224 of the Supreme People's Court: [REDACTED]mei (Tianjin) Image Technology Co., Ltd. v. Henan [REDACTED]lu Bee Industry Co., Ltd. (dispute over the infringement of the right of communication to the public on information networks) (Deliberated and approved by the Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court, and issued on December 15, 2023) Guiding Case No. 224 Keywords: civil action, infringe the right of communication to the public on information networks, ownership, burden of proof Key Points of Judgment In case of disputed copyright ownership, determining the ownership of copyright on a work cannot rely only on a watermark or copyright notice. The party claiming copyright must provide additional evidence; otherwise, it will bear adverse legal consequences. Basic Facts G* Company, a non-party, authorized [REDACTED]mei (Tianjin) Image Technology Co., Ltd. ([REDACTED]mei) to display, sell, and license the company's images, branded as "getty Images," in China. [REDACTED]mei had the right to sue for infringement in its own name. [REDACTED]mei discovered that Henan [REDACTED]lu Bee Industry Co., Ltd. ([REDACTED]lu) used four of the images without permission. [REDACTED]mei sued for copyright infringement, requesting a judgment that [REDACTED]lu should compensate for economic losses and reasonable rights enforcement expenses. To substantiate its claims, [REDACTED]mei submitted evidence, including the authorization confirmation letter issued by G* Company and the copyright notice on its website. The images in question were marked with the watermark "getty Images(r)." [REDACTED]lu argued that the trademark registration mark "(r)" in the upper right corner of the watermark was not the author's signature, indicating the identity of the creator. Additionally, there was the photographer's signature and another brand name below the watermark, suggesting that the copyright of the images belonged to the author rather than to [REDACTED]mei or G* Company. [REDACTED]lu also sent an email to G* Company, inquiring about the ownership of the images. [REDACTED]lu received a reply stating that the images were contributed by photographers. G* Company sold them in its own name, paying royalties to the photographers, who retained the copyright. On that basis, [REDACTED]lu argued that since the photographers retained the copyright, neither G* Company nor [REDACTED]mei held copyright over the images, warranting the dismissal of [REDACTED]mei's claims. Judgment On September 17, 2019, the Third Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin Municipality rendered the Civil Judgment (No. 73 [2019], First, Civil, IP), ordering [REDACTED]lu to compensate [REDACTED]mei for economic losses and reasonable expenses totaling 8,000 yuan and dismissing the claims of [REDACTED]mei. [REDACTED]lu appealed the first-instance judgment. On July 16, 2020, the High People's Court of Tianjin Municipality issued Civil Judgment (No. 311 [2020], Final, Civil, Tianjin), dismissing the appeal and affirming the original judgment. [REDACTED]lu petitioned the Supreme People's Court for a retrial. The Supreme People's Court ruled to review this case and rendered the Civil Judgment (No. 355 [2021], Retrial, Civil, SPC) on December 20, 2021, reversing the first and second-instance judgments and dismissing all the claims of [REDACTED]mei. Judgment's Reasons The Supreme People's Court holds that, in addition to the "Getty Images(r)" watermark, the images in question were marked with the photographer's signature and another brand name. Furthermore, since "Getty Images" was immediately followed by the trademark registration mark "(r)," the watermark alone was insufficient to establish that the copyright belonged to G* Company. [REDACTED]mei also submitted evidence, including the authorization confirmation letter issued by G* Company and the copyright notice on its website. However, the authorization confirmation letter only confirmed that G* Company granted authorization to [REDACTED]mei and did not serve as evidence that G* Company held the copyright to the images. The copyright notice, as a unilateral statement, was insufficient to determine copyright ownership in the absence of corroborating evidence. In such a case, [REDACTED]mei should provide additional evidence that G* Company owned the copyright, but it failed to do so. On the other hand, according to the rebuttal evidence, such as G* Company's email submitted by [REDACTED]lu, G* Company confirmed that the contributing photographers retained the copyright to the images. Therefore, [REDACTED]mei's contention that G* Company owned the copyright was not established, and its relevant claims in this case should not be upheld.
