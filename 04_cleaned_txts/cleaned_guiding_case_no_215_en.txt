Basic Facts Kunming Min [REDACTED] Paper Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as [REDACTED] Paper) was formed on November 16, 2005, with a registered capital of 1 million yuan. Huang [REDACTED]hai held 80% of shares, Huang [REDACTED]fen 10%, and Huang [REDACTED]long 10%. Li [REDACTED]cheng was the logistics director of [REDACTED] Paper. After its formation, [REDACTED] Paper secretly laid pipes along the Tanglang River, a tributary of the Jinsha River in the Yangtze River Basin. These pipes connected to the company's production workshop's wastewater pipeline and were used to discharge industrial wastewater. According to an appraisal, during the period of illegal wastewater discharge by [REDACTED] Paper, the water quality indicators in the Tanglang River exceeded baseline levels by 13 to 239.1 times. These activities resulted in pollution to the surface water environment of the Tanglang River and a total reduction of 3,009,662 yuan in operating expenses for wastewater pollution control facilities. Calculated by using the virtual control cost method, the environmental pollution damage amounted to 10,815,021 yuan. Furthermore, these activities had an adverse impact on the ecological functions of the lower reaches of the Jinsha River Basin. While [REDACTED] Paper's production and business activities caused ecological and environmental damage, its shareholders conducted the following activities: (1) They collected company's receivables totaling 124,642,613.1 yuan through personal bank accounts, without including these transactions in the company's financial records. (2) They and their spouses registered the nine properties of the company, valued at 8,920,611 yuan, in their respective names, for uncompensated possession. (3) The company's books were not separated from the shareholders' books, and it was difficult to distinguish between company property and shareholder property and between shareholder gains and company profits. Since the case occurred, [REDACTED] Paper had ceased production, and the available balance in its corporate account was only 18,261.05 yuan. On April 12, 2021, the People's Procuratorate of Xishan District of Kunming City, Yunnan Province (hereinafter referred to as Xishan Procuratorate) announced the relevant information of this case. Throughout the announcement period, no legally provided organ or relevant organization initiated civil public interest litigation. The Xishan Procuratorate subsequently filed a public prosecution against [REDACTED] Paper, Huang [REDACTED]hai, and Li [REDACTED]cheng for the aforementioned acts. Additionally, it initiated civil public interest litigation incidental to the criminal proceedings against the company and its shareholders. The prosecution sought to disregard the independent status of [REDACTED] Paper and hold its shareholders jointly and severally liable for ecological and environmental damage caused by [REDACTED] Paper. Judgment On June 30, 2022, the Primary People's Court of Xishan District of Kunming City, Yunnan Province rendered the Civil Public Interest Litigation Judgment Incidental to Criminal Proceedings (No. 752 [2021], First, Criminal, 0112, Yunnan), in which: defendant entity [REDACTED] Paper was found guilty of the crime of environmental pollution and was fined 2,000,000 yuan; defendant Huang [REDACTED]hai was found guilty of the crime of environmental pollution and was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of three years and six months, and was fined 500,000 yuan; defendant Li [REDACTED]cheng was found guilty of the crime of environmental pollution and was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of three years and six months, and was fined 500,000 yuan; defendant [REDACTED] Paper was ordered to pay 10,815,021 yuan in compensation for ecological and environmental damage within ten days after the judgment took effect, and this amount was to be deposited into the Kunming Environmental Public Interest Litigation and Relief Special Fund Account for ecological and environmental repair; [REDACTED] Paper, the defendant of the civil public interest litigation incidental to criminal proceedings, was directed to pay 129,500 yuan to the Xishan Procuratorate for appraisal and testing costs within ten days after the judgment took effect; Huang [REDACTED]hai, Huang [REDACTED]fen, and Huang [REDACTED]long, the defendants of the civil public interest litigation incidental to criminal proceedings, were jointly and severally liable for compensation for ecological and environmental damage and appraisal and testing costs to be paid by [REDACTED] Paper. After the judgment was pronounced, neither the defendants nor the prosecution appealed, and the first-instance judgment became effective. The case has entered the enforcement phase, and the current available property value for enforcement has covered the subject matter of enforcement. Reasons for the Judgment The court's effective judgment held that in the course of business operations, enterprises should undertake the social responsibility of reasonably utilizing resources, implementing measures to prevent pollution, and protecting the environment. [REDACTED] Paper disregarded its social responsibility for environmental protection, violated the law of the state, and, in the absence of a discharge permit, discharged untreated production wastewater through concealed pipes, causing severe environmental pollution. This conduct constituted the crime of environmental pollution provided by Article 338 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China. Defendants Huang [REDACTED]hai and Li [REDACTED]cheng, as the directly responsible executive staff and directly responsible person of the defendant entity [REDACTED] Paper, both playing an equal role in the unit crime, should also be held criminally liable for the crime of environmental pollution. [REDACTED] Paper discharged production wastewater directly into the river through concealed pipes without permission, causing ecological and environmental damage amounting to 10,815,021 yuan. This discharge also had a certain impact on the ecological functions of the downstream Jinsha River Basin, constituting a severe harm to the public interest in the environment. As a result, [REDACTED] Paper should be held criminally liable in accordance with the law and also be held civilly liable for compensation for ecological and environmental damage. While pursuing economic benefits, [REDACTED] Paper, the defendant of the civil public interest litigation incidental to criminal proceedings, disregarded its obligation of environmental protection, resulting in severe damage to the public interest in the environment through its production and business activities. The damages and appraisal and testing costs to be paid by [REDACTED] Paper constituted its debts arising from environmental tort. Because [REDACTED] Paper engaged in extensive and frequent financial transactions with its shareholders, Huang [REDACTED]hai, Huang [REDACTED]fen, and Huang [REDACTED]long, since its formation, and the shareholders gratuitously possessed company property, which constitutes hig degree of personality confusion with [REDACTED] Paper, it could be determined that the shareholders abused the independent status of legal person of the company and the limited liability of shareholders, as provided in paragraph 3 of Article 20 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China. The total debts arising from environmental tort payable by [REDACTED] Paper amounted to 10,944,521 yuan, far exceeding its registered capital of 1,000,000 yuan. Moreover, [REDACTED] Paper had ceased production since the case was filed, and the available balance in its corporate account was only 18,261.05 yuan. The above facts indicated that the high degree of personality confusion between the shareholders and [REDACTED] Paper rendered it incapable of satisfying its debts arising from environmental tort. [REDACTED] Paper's inability to perform its obligation to pay compensation for ecological and environmental damage met the requirements for shareholders to be held jointly and severally liable, as provided in paragraph 3 of Article 20 of the Company Law of the People's Republic of China. Huang [REDACTED]hai, Huang [REDACTED]fen, and Huang [REDACTED]long should be jointly and severally liable for [REDACTED] Paper's debts arising from environmental tort. Relevant Provisions 1.
